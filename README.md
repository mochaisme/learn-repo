# Congrats!
Congratulations on reaching the end of the first chapter! ✨

Here's a recap of everything we have learned in this chapter:

git init for creating a new repository on our local machine.
git remote for connecting our local repository to GitHub.
git branch for renaming our branch.
git add and git commit for staging and committing our changes.
git status for checking the status of our files.
git push for pushing our code to GitHub.
This is a lot to digest! 😵‍💫 So make sure to save this:

- [ ] git init
- [ ] git remote add origin <repository_url>
- [ ] git branch -M main
- [ ] git add .
- [ ] git commit -m 'Your commit message here!'
- [ ] git status
- [ ] git push -u origin main

Let's wrap up the chapter with something fun and creative!
